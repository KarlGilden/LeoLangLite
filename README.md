# Leolang demo

Leolang is a powerful application designed to help you learn te reo Māori through reading.
The application features an easy to use word look up system using the native SelectionAPI, as well as a maintained dictionary which falls back to Google Translate if the translation is not found.

This is a lightweight demo with the goal of featuring the reading tool and dictionary. When paired with a guided courses, grammar guide, and a maintained library of content, the application will be an excellent way to teach te reo Māori.
