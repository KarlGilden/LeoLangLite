# Leolang demo https://leolang.netlify.app/

## What is it?
Leolang is a powerful application designed to help you learn te reo Māori through reading.

The application features an easy to use word look up system using the native SelectionAPI, as well as a maintained dictionary which falls back to Google Translate if the translation is not found. The user can save words and phrases and download them later into a Anki formatted .txt file.

This is a lightweight demo with the goal of featuring the reading tool and dictionary. When paired with guided courses, grammar guides, and a maintained library of content, the application will be an excellent way to teach te reo Māori.

## Why reading?
The premise of reading is based on Stephen Krashen's input hypothesis and comprehensible input. The theory places an emphasis on input of the target language rather than grammar instruction and tests. Reading, especially when paired with audio, is a great way of getting input and exposing yourself to as many Māori words and phrases as possible.
